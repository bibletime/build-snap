This builds a snap package for BibleTime.

This snap should be built using Ubuntu 18.04 or later.
Install snapd. See https://snapcraft.io for details. 

Install the latest version of 
snapcraft using "sudo snap install snapcraft". Also install multipass using snap.

Do not add pkg-config because the wrong include path is produced by FindSword.cmake.
The Qt version is determined by the runtime files. Use the runtime core18 (Qt 5.9.5)
until core20 is available which will be when Ubuntu 20.04 releases.

NOTE: Remember that a snap runs in its own file system. It will not use
your $HOME/.sword and $HOME/.bibletime.



local build steps:

cd to the directory above the "snap" directory containing snapcraft.yaml.
    snapcraft
    sudo snap install --dangerous bibletime_master-HEAD_amd64.snap
    which bibletime     (check to see if this is the snap version)
    bibletime  (run it)



remote build for snap store:

In the snapcraft.yaml file edit the following values the stable release:

    grade: stable (or devel for non-stable release including release candidate) 

    bibletime:
         source: <path to the release source file archive.>

Use the following command to remotely build BibleTime:
    snapcraft remote-build

When the build is complete push it to the ubuntu store:
    snapcraft push --release beta  bibletime_3.0.0-beta2_amd64.snap
where --release is edge, beta, candidate, or don't use option for stable.

To install from snap store:

    sudo snap install bibletime --beta (--candidate or --stable)
