This builds a snap packate for BibleTime.

Because of the usage of core18, this snap must be built using Ubuntu 18.04.
Install snapd. See https://snapcraft.io for details. Install the latest version of 
snapcraft using "sudo snap install snapcraft".

Do not add pkg-config because the wrong include path is produced by FindSword.cmake.

build steps:

cd to the "snap" directory containing snapcraft.yaml and this README`.

snapcraft

sudo snap install --dangerous bibletime_master-HEAD_amd64.snap

which bibletime     (check to see if this is the snap version)

bibletime  (run it)

NOTE: Remember that a snap runs in its own file system. It will not use
your $HOME/.sword and $HOME/.bibletime.
